# MyPathToDevOps
This repository will be used to reflect my journey into DevOps; here I will publish various materials and information about what and how I studied. 
I think that such repositories are currently necessary not only for every beginner, but also for every experienced specialist, in order to use such materials at least as a cheat sheet, and at most, take some points and use them in their projects.
