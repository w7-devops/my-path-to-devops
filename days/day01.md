# about me at this moment in time
### reason
I had the idea that at the beginning and end of the blog I should talk about myself, my experience, in order to see my progress.
### about me
So, I’m an ordinary 16-year-old student who recently started studying devops. 
I myself have been programming since 2023 and during this time I have changed many languages, I have tried programming languages ​​such as java, js, python and c++. 
I studied areas such as artificial intelligence, and studied a little material about cybersecurity and backend. 
To put it simply, I already have experience in programming.

# plan
My plans at the moment are to study Golang and Bash, since these tools will not be superfluous in the work of devops (also, I will study Golang to use it in the backend)
