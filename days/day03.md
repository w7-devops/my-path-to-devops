# day plan & results
My plans for the day were as follows: learn the basic syntax of Golang (data types, loops, conditionals). 

And I accomplished this goal, in conclusion I wrote a couple of programs:
1. ![mini-calculator](https://github.com/w7-devops/my-path-to-devops/tree/main/studying/golang/mini-calc) 
2. ![mini-game](https://github.com/w7-devops/my-path-to-devops/tree/main/studying/golang/minigame)
